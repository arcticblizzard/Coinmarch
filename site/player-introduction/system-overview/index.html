    <h1 id="system-overview">System Overview</h1>
<p>Below is a distilled overview of relevant <em>Warlock!</em> mechanics. Rulebook page numbers can be found next to section headers if more detailed information is needed.</p>
<h2 id="skill-tests">Skill Tests</h2>
<p><em>Page 58</em></p>
<p>Everything that a character attempts to do which is dramatic and where failure advances the story as much as success is resolved via a skill test. Basic skill tests are for when characters attempt to impose themselves upon the world around them, while an opposed skill test has the character in direct conflict with another individual.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Skill Test</strong>: Roll <code>1d20 + relevant skill</code>. A total of <strong>20 or more</strong> is a success.<ul>
<li>Natural 20 = critical success.</li>
<li>GM may assign ± modifiers to adjust difficulty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Opposed Skill Test</strong>: Each party rolls <code>1d20 + relevant skill</code>.<ul>
<li>Higher total wins.</li>
<li>Ties are either determined by a reroll or by a Basic Luck Test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="luck-tests">Luck Tests</h2>
<p><em>Page 60</em></p>
<p>Luck tests exist to avoid unfortunate circumstances from an action or even of the world around the character.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic Luck Test</strong>: Roll <code>1d20 + Luck attribute</code>. A total of <strong>20 or more</strong> is a success.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>All Luck tests (regardless of outcome) reduce the character’s Luck attribute by 1.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p><em>Page 74</em></p>
<p>Attacks between combatants are resolved as opposed tests - the winner hits the loser and inflicts damage. Combat is divided into rounds, roughly representing 30 seconds.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to take damage as an attacker if you roll badly in the opposed test</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initiative</strong>: Initiate is usually determined by the narrative (which party is more prepared for the fight?). In situations where that cannot be easily determined, each side rolls <code>1d6</code>, and the highest roll side goes first. Turn order within the group is determined amongst the group.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each Round</strong>, a character may:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Move: characters may move up to around 10 feet cautiously as part of their action (free movement). If a character desired to move beyond that limitation, they must spend their action doing so. Characters taking the Move action can move one step between the ranges.</p>
<p>:::info
Distance is covered in an abstract method (Close, Nearby, Faraway, or Distant).
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a melee or ranged attack</p>
</li>
<li>Cast a spell or use a knack,</li>
<li>Take another meaningful action (e.g., draw weapon, interact with environment).</li>
<li><strong>To Attack</strong>: Roll <code>1d20 + weapon skill +5 (for attacking)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>:::info
Ranged attacks at a distance of Faraway or greater may be penalized -5 on the roll.
:::</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defender rolls <code>1d20 + appropriate defense skill</code> (Weapon Skill, Dodge, etc.).</p>
<p>:::info
For Ranged attacks: if the defender is aware of the attack and also has a shield, they apply a +3 and +5 bonus to their Dodge check for Small and Large shields respectively.
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher roll hits and applies weapon damage roll</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>:::info
Mighty Strikes: If the winner of an Attack check rolls a natural 20 or rolls more than <strong>3x</strong> the result of the defender, they achieve a Mighty Strike; <strong>Double the overall attack damage</strong>.
:::</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="damage-armour-and-recovery">Damage, Armour, and Recovery</h2>
<p><em>Page 81</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Damage</strong>: Weapons list a damage die (e.g., <code>1d6</code>, <code>1d8</code>). Roll and subtract the target's <strong>Armour</strong> value.The remaining damage is removed from <strong>Stamina</strong>.</p>
<p>:::danger
Even with armor and a shield, being struck will always cause at least 1 point of stamina loss (even if reduced to zero or lower).
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Provides a flat <strong>damage soak</strong> <code>1d3</code> for Light Armor, <code>1d6</code> for Medium Armor, and <code>2d6</code> for Heavy Armor.</p>
<p>:::info
Shields increase the armor level of a character by one rank (excluding Heavy Armor).
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Critical Hits</strong>: When a character takes damage that brings them to <strong>below 0 Stamina</strong>, this is a critical hit. The character suffers a critical hit effect by rolling a <code>1d6</code> against an appropriate critical hit table (Page 85).</p>
<p>:::danger
If the damage taken was enough to reduce stamina BELOW 0, add one to the Critical Roll for each negative point of stamina.
:::</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recovery</strong>: Characters recover <strong>half</strong> of their lost stamina as soon as they take half an hour to catch their breath, during which time they may do nothing but rest. The remaining stamina is recovered after a good night’s sleep. Critical injuries take much longer to recover from and is determined by the GM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="magic-general">Magic (General)</h2>
<p>Magic in <em>Warlock!</em> comes <strong>exclusively</strong> from entities outside of the mortal realm: gods, demons, abberations, etc. Spells are nothing more than requests upon these beings and are initiated through the act of reciting from a spell scroll.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Casting Spells</strong>:<ul>
<li>The spell caster pays the required amount of Stamina</li>
<li>Roll <code>1d20 + Incantation</code><ul>
<li>A total of <strong>20+</strong> is required to succeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Magical Mishaps:</strong> Natural 1 = the spell caster has <em>potentially</em> miscast their spell.<ul>
<li>The spell fails</li>
<li>They must immediately attempt another Incantation skill test<ul>
<li><strong>Success</strong> \= nothing happens</li>
<li><strong>Failure</strong> \= Roll <code>1d20</code> on the miscast table (Page 94).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
