# Lower Kolnmark

## Overview
Lower Kolnmark is the bustling lower city tucked between the river and the towering causeway. Its winding streets host everything from busy wharves and markets to cramped tenements and shadowy alleys.

## Bargebreaker Island  
A soot-blackened, craggy island nestled in the mouth of the Koln River, Bargebreaker Island connects the East and West banks of Kolnmark via the Blackspans—two ancient stone bridges, darkened by generations of coal smoke. A place of industry and consequence, the island has a reputation as black as its buildings.

## Breakbay Docks  
An expansive waterfront district hugging the deep, sheltered waters of Breakbay. As Kolnmark’s principal deep-water port, it bustles with the largest ocean-going vessels, surrounded by cranes, warehouses, and the shipping offices that keep regional trade moving.

## Callus Run  
A bustling arc of workshops and storefronts along the north edge of Kolnmark’s lower-city thoroughfare, Callus Run stretches from the foot of the Blackspans to the fringe of Greenwold. Its shop windows gleam with hand-made wares, and the steady flow of craftsmen, apprentices and shoppers keeps the street alive from dawn until dusk.

## Caskside  
A bustling artisan quarter on the western bank of the Koln River, Caskside rose up when Kolnmark spilled beyond its old walls.  Its heartbeat is cooperage—barrel-making for beer, wine and spirits—and the breweries, distilleries, and cellars that crowd its narrow lanes.  The Caskside Docks handle the inflow of specialty goods and the outflow of premier potables, making this district the city’s craft and liquid-export hub.

## Cliff Cove  
Cliff Cove is the northernmost industrial foothold of the lower city, wedged between the Blade Sea’s rocky inlet, the high eastern cliffs, and the western piers of the old causeway. A single deep-water dock and a hidden beach haul-out keep the lifeblood of trade flowing up to the heights above, all bound behind a vigilant sea wall.

## Clerk’s Ward  
A compact enclave anchoring Kolnmark’s lower city core, Clerk’s Ward faces the broad boulevards and the leafy expanse of the Greenwold. At its heart stands the walled Hall of Records—a stately courtyarded complex where public ledgers, charters, and petitions are filed and reviewed. Here the pulse of daily civic life beats in the shuffle of parchment and the measured steps of robed clerks.

## Dockshade  
A vibrant quarter serving both Eastchain and Breakbay docks, Dockshade is lower Kolnmark’s entertainment hub—where dockhands and captains alike unwind amid playhouses, taverns, and lounges. At its southern edge it even fronts the Greenwold, blending bayside revelry with leafy respite.

## Eastchain Docks  
A sprawling web of quays, piers and slipways on the east bank of the River Koln, Eastchain Docks stretches from the Blackspans up to the Point. Two shanty-strewn isles lie offshore—home to ramshackle fishing boats and squatters beyond city law—while a bustling southern market spills onto the waterfront, alive with exotic wares from distant seas.

## Eastcliff Row  
A tiered ribbon of homes clinging to the cliff’s base and flanks, Eastcliff Row stretches north of the Spire, where sunlight scarce in the lower city finds purchase on its southern houses. Here, lower-income tenements rub shoulders with tidier middle-class dwellings, all overlooking the market stalls and mysterious warehouse at the cliff’s foot.

## Gatefold  
A medium-sized, tightly packed residential quarter tucked against the Lower City wall and Market Gate. Gatefold’s narrow lanes funnel traffic from the Greenwold to the great market beyond the city gate, while its artisans and merchants live in the same rowhouses that once housed the gate’s original sentries.

## Garrison Row  
A compact, fortress-like enclave at the foot of the Spine causeway, Garrison Row is home to Kolnmark’s professional solders-for-hire. Walled barracks, training yards, and communal facilities cluster along narrow, regimented streets.

## Hearthrow  
A broad swath of lower-city living bounded by the eastern banks of the Koln River, the main east–west thoroughfare to the north, the Greenwold to the east, and the old city wall to the south. Hearthrow’s tree-lined streets accommodate elegant riverside villas, sturdy middle-class homes, and clustered tenements—one of the lower city’s largest residential quarters.

## Ironhook  
Perched on the approach to the Spine and shadowed by the Breakbay cliffs, Ironhook is the city’s premier armorer and outfitter district. Its workshops and caverns churn day and night to supply the mercenaries of Garrison’s Row with weapons, armor, and provisions.

## Newbrick Ward  
A garden-lined neighborhood on the western bank of the Koln River, Newbrick Ward grew up when Kolnmark’s city walls pushed westward.  It links the Westgate to the Blackspans via the busy Timber Road—where log-drivers, merchants and craftsmen stream upriver.  Though a few workshops and a large riverside shrine dot its lanes, Newbrick remains chiefly a place to live: tidy brick terraces, modest townhouses and winding lanes leading home.

## Pilgrim’s Way  
Nestled in the shadow of the Spire along the pilgrims’ thoroughfare, Pilgrim’s Way caters to well-heeled visitors making their devotions. Elegant inns, tranquil gardens, and refined taverns line the broad, flag-stone street, offering respite, fine fare, and exclusive souvenirs to clergy, nobles, and foreign dignitaries.

## The Point  
A broad stone promontory dividing Eastchain from Breakbay Docks, The Point is Kolnmark’s maritime nerve center—where harbor masters, customs agents and dock officials oversee the endless flow of ships. Its southern marshaling grounds roar with inspections, cargo staging and heavy machinery, while a towering lighthouse crowns the tip, guiding vessels through swirling currents.

## The Stumble  
A cramped, rowdy leisure quarter wedged between Breakbay Docks and Garrison Row, The Stumble caters almost exclusively to the city’s hired swords. Cheap lodgings, boisterous taverns, and back-alley diversions draw mercenaries off duty into its lantern-lit streets.

## The Tangle  
A claustrophobic warren of narrow, winding lanes wedged between the River Docks and Breakbay Quay, The Tangle is one of Kolnmark’s poorest quarters. Crumbling tenements lean over cobblestones worn smooth by decades of cart traffic, while a raucous 24-hour market rages at its crooked heart and a weekly puppet spectacle draws crowds despite the squalor.

## Tumbledown  
Tumbledown is the poorest district in all of Kolnmark, tucked entirely beneath the shattered arches of the Giant’s Causeway. Precarious tenements and ramshackle huts cling to the cliff face and the immense, overhanging stone columns. Here, the city’s destitute eke out a living in near-perpetual shadow.

## Wallwrights  
A narrow ribbon of workshops and stalls pressed up against Kolnmark’s ancient wall, the Wallwrights District specializes in the fine stone-, glass-, and metal-work that outfits the Spire and the city’s wealthier quarters. A bustling market plaza hums day and night with merchants trading luxury embellishments, architectural fittings, and the rarest building materials.
