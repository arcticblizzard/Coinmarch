# Twinreach

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

Twinreach is the city’s foremost artisan quarter, stretching from the bustling Twin Gates thoroughfare eastward to the High Road at the East Gate. Renowned for its concentration of workshops and merchant stalls, its northwest park offers a leafy oasis amid the clang of hammers and hum of looms.

## History & Role

Once a grove dotted with small cottages, Twinreach was gradually overtaken by journeymen smiths, weavers, and glassblowers in Kolnmark’s early expansion. By the age of the Spire’s construction it had become the Kingdom’s premier craft district—its goods traded across the Blade Sea and beyond.

## Economy & Activity

Twinreach thrives on the sale and display of handcrafted wares:  
- Forgers, carpenters, leatherworkers, and glassblowers keep shop in narrow lanes, each workshop a hive of industry.  
- An open‐air market of stalls circles the district’s park daily, peddling finished tools, textiles, and curios.  
- Larger houses like The Ember & Anvil and The Silver Bell Taproom cater to craftsmen, merchants, and visiting clients with hearty fare and stout ale.  
- Small inns and lodgings over workshops offer apprentices and traveling buyers a place to rest.

## Inhabitants

A dense population of master artisans, journeymen, and apprentices inhabits Twinreach, alongside itinerant merchants and laborers. Residences range from modest garrets above the smithies to crowded inns lining Forge Street.

## Notable Locations

- **Mastermaker Park** – A broad, trimmed‐hedge square in the northwest, laid out with flowering beds, winding paths, and sculpted stone benches. Rising in the park’s center, a crystal‐domed gazebo of aquamarine stone and filigreed spires hosts guild demonstrations, minstrels’ performances, and seasonal fairs.
- **Artisan Row** – A large group of small retail shops opening up onto the park, each showcasing the district’s finest copperware, leather goods, glassware, and finely woven cloths.  
- **The Ember & Anvil** – A large timber-framed eatery near the East Gate, its roaring hearth and iron-forged décor serving molten iron ale and blackened roast to workshop hands and contract brokers alike.  
- **The Silver Bell Taproom** – Perched on Forge Street, known for its spiced peppercorn ale, nightly bardic recitals, and cordial welcome to both local journeymen and visiting dignitaries.
- **Moonfire Kilns** – Nestled at Twinreach’s southern edge, a horseshoe of compact workshops surrounds a shared courtyard of glowing embers. Here master glassblowers forge moonfire glass, a rare mineral-infused crystal that absorbs daylight and softly radiates at night—shaping everything from lantern lenses and inlaid jewelry to luminescent display spheres that light the courtyard long after the kilns cool.
