# Gatefold

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

A medium-sized, tightly packed residential quarter tucked against the Lower City wall and Market Gate. Gatefold’s narrow lanes funnel traffic from the Greenwold to the great market beyond the city gate, while its artisans and merchants live in the same rowhouses that once housed the gate’s original sentries.

## History & Role

Originally built to lodge the families of gate-keepers and customs clerks, Gatefold grew up around the stone gateway that controlled trade in and out of Kolnmark. As the city expanded, many of those old guard-houses were converted into workshops and tenements. Though the gate and wall remain reminders of the district’s defensive origins, Gatefold today is firmly a home for the artisans and market folk who ply their trades in the adjacent Wallwrights and Market Gate districts.

## Economy & Activity

Gatefold’s economy revolves around small-scale craftsmanship and provisioning the Market Gate. You’ll find blade-sharpeners, leatherworkers, coopers and dyers living above their shops, and street-vendors selling supplies to traders heading north. Gatefold’s tight streets bustle at dawn with traders carrying produce from the Greenwold, and fall silent by nightfall—save for the occasional tavern patron or city watch patrol.

## Inhabitants

Gatefold is home to journeymen craftspeople, market assistants, porters and their families. Many work in the cities’ larger workshop districts by day and retire to compact, stacked tenements at night. Outsiders often remark on the friendly, familial atmosphere—and the ever-present hammering, sawing and call of the market crier that drifts through the alleyways.

## Notable Locations

- **Market Gate Arch** – The ornate stone archway through which all northern trade must pass. Its carved reliefs depict the city’s founding and still bear scorch marks from past sieges.  
- **Tenement Square** – A quiet courtyard ringed by four-story rowhouses, where neighbors gather to share meals and gossip in the evenings.  
- **The Rusty Bolt** – A cozy, low-rent tavern tucked down a back alley, famous for its strong ale and nightly group game of dice.
- **Riverside Clayworks** – A squat brick building with tall chimneys on a bend of the Koln. Local potters utilized dredged river-clay here to craft tiles, bricks and sturdy vessels used throughout the district.  
- **Chapel of the Heartstone** – A modest white-stone shrine set amid stables and smithies. Artisans pause here each morning to leave a chip of iron or clay in thanks for steady hands.
