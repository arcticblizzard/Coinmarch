# Highforge

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

Perched on the windswept promontory that juts into the Blade Sea, Highforge is a compact enclave of master artisans who fashion luxury goods for Kolnmark’s elite. Its steep cliffs offer dramatic sea views, while Cliff Cove lifts disgorge exotic shipments that fuel Highforge’s bespoke workshops.

## History & Role

Once a humble fishing outpost, Highforge was reborn when the Cliff Cove lift network opened, bringing in silks, spices, rare metals, and sea-glass. Drawn by its proximity to the seat of power in Bannercrest and the glittering entertainments of Dawnwatch, guildmasters established their finest ateliers here, turning Highforge into the city’s premier district for high-end craft and commission work.

## Economy & Activity

Highforge thrives on bespoke luxury and maritime imports:  
- Master metalworkers forge damascene steel and ornate ironwork from exotic ores.  
- Glassblowers shape colored sea-glass into chandeliers, lanterns, and delicate vessels.  
- Weavers at Silkreef Draperies dye rare silks with pigments drawn from oceanic minerals.  
- Navigational-instrument makers produce gilded compasses and sextants for Bannercrest’s naval escorts.  
- The Cliff Cove Customs office auctions off exotic crates to the highest-bidding workshops.  

## Inhabitants

A tight-knit population of master craftsmen, journeymen and their families; a handful of skilled dockhands keep the lifts running; and patron architects, merchants, and bureaucrats from Bannercrest flit between ateliers. The scent of hot metal, fresh paint, and salty sea air hangs over every workshop.

## Notable Locations

- **Promontory Foundry** – A vaulted smithy built near the cliff’s edge, where master smiths temper damascene steel beneath roaring forges.  
- **Glasswind Atelier** – A glass-domed workshop where artisans spin sea-glass into jeweled goblets and lanterns.  
- **Cliff Cove Customs** – The squat granite exchange house near the lift terminus, where exotic cargo is cataloged and workshop bids are opened each dawn.  
- **Silkreef Draperies** – A two-story weaving hall near the main road, famed for its ocean-hued silks and salt-stained tapestries.  
- **Mariners’ Canopy** – An open-arced pavilion of fine ropeworks and compass makers, its carved beams echoing with the murmur of visiting captains.
