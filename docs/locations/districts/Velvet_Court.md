# Velvet Court

**District Type**: Leisure

## Summary

Velvet Court is a compact enclave of opulence and indulgence on Upper Kolnmark’s southern flank. Its centerpiece is an open-air spa and garden complex built atop a marble crepidoma, where wealthy patrons soak in thermal pools and stroll fragrant walkways. Along the district’s southern edge, velvet-draped pleasure houses offer discreet entertainments, while refined taverns near the Foreign Quarter cater to visiting dignitaries seeking comforts of home.

## History & Role

Founded by a consortium of spa-minded nobles in the waning days of the old Empire, Velvet Court transformed a windswept plateau into a sanctuary of luxury. Its marble terraces and imported horticultural specimens were designed to rival fabled eastern healing gardens. Over the centuries, as Kolnmark’s mercenary companies grew wealthy, they flocked here to unwind—and Velvet Court grew ever more lavish, evolving into the city’s premier indulgence quarter.

## Economy & Activity

Velvet Court thrives on high-end leisure services and hospitality:  
- **Open-Air Spa & Gardens**: Managed by the House of Caldara, its thermal pools, steam grottoes, and massage pavilions command top coin.  
- **Pleasure Houses**: A half-dozen discreet establishments offering music, dance, and companionship, each adorned with velvet drapes and perfumed baths.  
- **Specialty Taverns**: Inns like the Amber Lamp import exotic spirits and rare teas to satisfy foreign tastes, maintaining close ties with Envoy’s Rest.  
- **Stalls & Kiosks**: Along quiet side lanes, jewelers, perfumers, and fine-linen merchants cater to spa patrons and court visitors.

## Inhabitants

A small permanent community of spa-masters, masseurs, perfumers, and entertainers maintains Velvet Court’s daily rituals. Patrons from the city’s elite, foreign envoys, and visiting commanders outnumber locals ten‐to‐one. The air is thick with steam, incense, and the murmur of discreet negotiations—here, relaxation is serious business.
