Though visible from the cliff-edge mansions above, its position on the main road makes it equally accessible to visiting nobles, merchants, and clergy. By day, it hosts ceremonial processions and oratory contests; by dusk, its acoustics fill with the strains of chamber orchestras, touring troupes’ dramas, and the hush of spectators under lamplit torches.",

Its blend of cutting-edge glasswork and stone architecture makes it both a scientific marvel and a favorite promenade for Highmarch’s elite.",
