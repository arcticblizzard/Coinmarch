# Kolnmark

## Overview & History

Coinmarch occupies a strategic perch at the mouth of the River Koln on the northern edge of the Blade Sea. In its earliest days it bore the name **Kolnmark**, home to a vast causeway and castle that stretched from the white cliffs out into the waters—an engineering marvel unmatched in scale and wonder. That mighty bridge and fortification was shattered in some long-forgotten calamity, its stones cast into the deep. From the ruins of old Kolnmark another city arose: today’s Coinmarch.

The modern city is cleaved in two by those same white cliffs—the bustling [Lower City](/Coinmarch/locations/LowerKolnmark) hugging the riverbanks below, and the grand [Upper City](/Coinmarch/locations/UpperKolnmark)  crowned atop the bluffs. They are joined only by the sloping thoroughfare called the Spine, which winds its way between merchant stalls below to marble-paved avenues above. Coinmarch has defined itself as the world’s premier home for mercenary companies, whose captains and commanders both live and do business here. Though the lands beyond are racked by endless war, none dare besiege the city that supplies the blade for every battle. In Coinmarch, conflict is currency—and its elite grow inexorably richer upon that strife.

## Lower Kolnmark

Lower Kolnmark is the bustling lower city tucked between the river and the towering causeway. Its winding streets host everything from busy wharves and markets to cramped tenements and shadowy alleys.

### Bargebreaker Island  
A soot-blackened, craggy island nestled in the mouth of the Koln River, Bargebreaker Island connects the East and West banks of Kolnmark via the Blackspans—two ancient stone bridges, darkened by generations of coal smoke. A place of industry and consequence, the island has a reputation as black as its buildings.

### Breakbay Docks  
An expansive waterfront district hugging the deep, sheltered waters of Breakbay. As Kolnmark’s principal deep-water port, it bustles with the largest ocean-going vessels, surrounded by cranes, warehouses, and the shipping offices that keep regional trade moving.

### Callus Run  
A bustling arc of workshops and storefronts along the north edge of Kolnmark’s lower-city thoroughfare, Callus Run stretches from the foot of the Blackspans to the fringe of Greenwold. Its shop windows gleam with hand-made wares, and the steady flow of craftsmen, apprentices and shoppers keeps the street alive from dawn until dusk.

### Caskside  
A bustling artisan quarter on the western bank of the Koln River, Caskside rose up when Kolnmark spilled beyond its old walls.  Its heartbeat is cooperage—barrel-making for beer, wine and spirits—and the breweries, distilleries, and cellars that crowd its narrow lanes.  The Caskside Docks handle the inflow of specialty goods and the outflow of premier potables, making this district the city’s craft and liquid-export hub.

### Cliff Cove  
Cliff Cove is the northernmost industrial foothold of the lower city, wedged between the Blade Sea’s rocky inlet, the high eastern cliffs, and the western piers of the old causeway. A single deep-water dock and a hidden beach haul-out keep the lifeblood of trade flowing up to the heights above, all bound behind a vigilant sea wall.

### Eastcliff Row  
A tiered ribbon of homes clinging to the cliff’s base and flanks, Eastcliff Row stretches north of the Spire, where sunlight scarce in the lower city finds purchase on its southern houses. Here, lower-income tenements rub shoulders with tidier middle-class dwellings, all overlooking the market stalls and mysterious warehouse at the cliff’s foot.

### Newbrick Ward  
A garden-lined neighborhood on the western bank of the Koln River, Newbrick Ward grew up when Kolnmark’s city walls pushed westward.  It links the Westgate to the Blackspans via the busy Timber Road—where log-drivers, merchants and craftsmen stream upriver.  Though a few workshops and a large riverside shrine dot its lanes, Newbrick remains chiefly a place to live: tidy brick terraces, modest townhouses and winding lanes leading home.

A claustrophobic warren of narrow, winding lanes wedged between the River Docks and Breakbay Quay, The Tangle is one of Kolnmark’s poorest quarters.
