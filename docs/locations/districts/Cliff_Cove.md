# Cliff Cove

**District Type**: Industrial

## Summary

Cliff Cove is the northernmost industrial foothold of the lower city, wedged between the Blade Sea’s rocky inlet, the high eastern cliffs, and the western piers of the old causeway. A single deep-water dock and a hidden beach haul-out keep the lifeblood of trade flowing up to the heights above, all bound behind a vigilant sea wall.

## History & Role

Originally a fishing cove at the base of the great cliff, Cliff Cove was later fortified against the seawater. Today it serves as a gateway for nearly all fine cargo bound to the upper city — from fine crafting materials, to exotic imports, and beyond — channeled through its mighty dock and mechanical haul stations.  

## Economy & Activity

– **Deep-Water Docking**: Most merchant vessels land here, unloading goods destined for the upper levels.  
– **Beach Haul-Out**: A small, flat strand where workboats and barges are careened and repaired.  
– **Sea Wall Maintenance**: Crews patrol and repair the stone barrier after every storm.  
– **Lift & Haul Operations**: Massive winches and pulleys lift cargo straight up the cliff to waiting caravans above—an expert vocation watched closely by the city’s shore engineers.

## Inhabitants

A lean community of dockworkers, lift-engineers, and sea-wall watchmen. Many live in sturdy stone tenements built into the cliff’s base, while a handful of tavern keepers and blacksmiths service both the dock hands and lift crews.

## Notable Locations

- **Cliff Cove Dock** – An impressive deep-water berth in the lower city’s northern reaches, lined with creaking cranes and warehouses.  
- **Ship Haulout Beach** – A narrow strip of sand where small craft are beached for hull repairs and cleaning.  
- **Sea Wall** – A continuous stone barrier, heavily buttressed and patrolled day and night.  
- **Causeway Lifts** – Two colossal winch-driven platforms, lovingly nicknamed "Clank" and "Clunk" that hoist cargo up the cliff face to the upper city.  
- **Engineers’ Watchtower** – A squat stone tower overlooking the lifts, where shore engineers monitor every turn of the winch.
- **The Rusted Anchor** – A weather-beaten tavern perched on pilings at the water’s edge. Inside, dockhands and lift-crews drink brine-spiced ales and swap sea-tales beneath lanterns made from old buoy glass.
- **Harborstone Forge** – A smoke-blackened smithy tucked into the cliff’s base, where ironworkers hammer out anchors, pulley components, and lift-gear for the causeway stations. The clang of hammer on anvil echoes across the cove.
