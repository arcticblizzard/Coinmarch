# Wallwrights District

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

A narrow ribbon of workshops and stalls pressed up against Kolnmark’s ancient wall, the Wallwrights District specializes in the fine stone-, glass-, and metal-work that outfits the Spire and the city’s wealthier quarters. A bustling market plaza hums day and night with merchants trading luxury embellishments, architectural fittings, and the rarest building materials.

## History & Role

Once little more than a backstreet servicing the wall’s occasional repairs, Wallwrights grew up around a small guild of masons who wintered here during the Spire’s construction. Over the decades it expanded to encompass everything from stonemasons carving ornate reliefs to glass-blowers forging the stained-glass panels that fill the Spire’s windows. Today it stands as the city’s premier source for high-end architectural accoutrements and ritual fittings.

## Economy & Activity

Work here is driven by two great demands: maintaining and adorning the Spire itself, and supplying the luxury tastes of the adjacent residential districts. Stone carvers hustle to fill orders for altar bases and column caps, glass-works hum with bellows and blowpipes crafting colored panes, while small forges fashion gilded ironwork and brass hardware. The central Market Gate Plaza hosts daily auctions of rare marbles, lapis inlays, and ivory inlay panels—materials trucked in from as far away as the southern quarries and far-off Desert Coast traders.

## Inhabitants

A mix of master craftsmen, journeyman artisans, and their apprentices fill the narrow lanes here; many families have worked the same trades for generations. Once a month the various “wright” guilds convene in the old wall-keep tavern to exchange news and negotiate commissions. Outside of work hours, most residents are as sparely housed as the narrow stone homes allow—but every window is pried wide to catch the glow of the Spire’s lamps at night.

## Notable Locations

- **Market Gate Plaza** – The heart of Wallwrights, this paved square rings with stalls and covered booths selling cut stone, stained-glass shards, polished metal fittings, and imported decorative veneers. A stone fountain at its center depicts the wall’s mythical founding.
- **Spire Stoneworks** – A long row of workshops beneath vaulted stone arches, where master masons hew and finish the blocks destined to repair or expand the Spire. Their dust motes drift into the street like snow.
- **Gleamsmith Forge** – A turreted building of blackened brick where glass-blowers and metal-casters share a single great chimney. Here the colored window panels and gilded grilles for the Spire take form.
- **Ivorycarver’s Row** – A narrow lane of cramped shops specializing in carved bone, ivory, and mother-of-pearl fittings—mantle inlays, reliquary panels, and high-status door pulls. Few craftsmen earn the prestige (or price) of a true “celeste sculptor.”
- **The Idle Implement** – A two-story timber-and-stone guild hall at the district’s southern end, with a roaring hearth, long communal tables, and billiards. Here masons, smiths, and glass‐workers unwind over hearty stews and ale, swap techniques, and recruit journeymen for new commissions.
