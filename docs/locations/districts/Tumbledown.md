# Tumbledown

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

Tumbledown is the poorest district in all of Kolnmark, tucked entirely beneath the shattered arches of the Giant’s Causeway. Precarious tenements and ramshackle huts cling to the cliff face and the immense, overhanging stone columns. Here, the city’s destitute eke out a living in near-perpetual shadow.

## History & Role

As the great stone viaduct crumbled, the land beneath it became a refuge for outcasts, runaway laborers, and those with nowhere else to turn. Over decades, a ramshackle community took root, built from fallen masonry and salvaged timber.

## Economy & Activity

- **Fishing & Scavenging**: A handful of hardy river-folk use rickety docks to land small catches at dawn, selling what they can for meager coin.  
- **Columnar Market**: Daily stalls ring a single, towering pillar—vendors hawk salvaged tools, tattered garments, and dubious tonics.  
- **Odd Jobs & Hauls**: Residents barter labor—hauling fallen stone, mending neighboring shacks, or guiding small boats beneath the arches.  
- **After-Dark Trades**: As night falls, dimly lit taverns serve cheap ale and house clandestine dealings in shadowed alcoves.

## Inhabitants

Tumbledown’s people are a hardy blend of river-bank families, former laborers, and those cast out by debts or scandal. Children play among the ruins, scaling columns as though climbing castle ramparts; elders spin tales of the Causeway’s glory days to keep hope alive. Crime is common—pickpockets, smugglers, and unlicensed healers ply their trades where city watch rarely ventures.

## Notable Locations

- **The Embering Flare** – A low-rent tavern built into a collapsed arch, its smoky hearth and potent spirits attract both fishermen and cutpurses after dark.  
- **Shale Slip Docks** – Three makeshift jetties of fallen masonry where small fishing skiffs beach at low tide and fish change hands at dawn.  
- **Columnar Market** – A cramped open market arrayed around a single massive Causeway pillar, trading in cast-off tools, worn clothing, and “miracle” tonics.  
- **The Hollowed Vault** – A clandestine speakeasy carved into the Causeway’s footing; vaulted stone ceilings echo with laughter, music, and whispered transactions.
