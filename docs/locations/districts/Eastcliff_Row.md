# Eastcliff Row

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

A tiered ribbon of homes clinging to the cliff’s base and flanks, Eastcliff Row stretches north of the Spire, where sunlight scarce in the lower city finds purchase on its southern houses. Here, lower-income tenements rub shoulders with tidier middle-class dwellings, all overlooking the market stalls and mysterious warehouse at the cliff’s foot.

## History & Role

Originally little more than a footpath beneath the Upper City cliffs, Eastcliff Row grew when laborers tunneling walls and foundations found ledges they could build upon. Over generations it became a compact residential enclave—workers and craftsmen nearer the cliff-base stalls, while better-heeled families moved into the sunlit terraces closer to the Spire.

## Economy & Activity

Daily life revolves around the cliff-shaded market—fresh produce, simple crafts, and cliff-harvested herbs are the main trade. Southward, small coopers, tailors and day-laborers commute up to the Upper City; northward, they unload and re-bottle goods beneath the cliffs. Evenings see quiet gatherings on the terraces, where Spire bells echo against the stone wall above.

## Inhabitants

A hardy mix of dockhands, market-stall keepers and their families fills the lower reaches, while the upper tiers claim minor clerks, artisans and junior Spire functionaries. Everyone here wears a fine layer of cliff-dust; few linger long without purpose.

## Notable Locations

- **Cliffside Market** – A narrow promenade of stalls and lean-tos at the cliff’s base, trading everything from salted halibut to hand-woven baskets beneath the great stone overhang.
- **Stonehaven Warehouse** – A squat, windowless storehouse built against the cliffs’ northern wall. Rumored to hold imported silks and rare spices, its single barred door is watched day and night by hooded sentries.
- **Spireview Terrace** – A row of modest yet well-kept homes perched in full southern sun, offering their residents rare views of the Spire’s glowing lanterns at dusk.
**Westbank Tenements** – A block of sturdy brick walk-ups on the west side, arranged around a shared cobbled courtyard. Weathered murals of fishing boats decorate the walls, and every porch rings with the clatter of children’s games.
