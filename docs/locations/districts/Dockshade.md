# Dockshade

**District Type**: Leisure

## Summary

A vibrant quarter serving both Eastchain and Breakbay docks, Dockshade is lower Kolnmark’s entertainment hub—where dockhands and captains alike unwind amid playhouses, taverns, and lounges. At its southern edge it even fronts the Greenwold, blending bayside revelry with leafy respite.

## History & Role

Originally a haven for tired mariners seeking diversion, Dockshade grew around the waterfront’s older inns and music halls. As the neighboring craft and dock districts boomed, entrepreneurs established playhouses and saloons to meet every taste and purse. Today it’s where deals are struck over wines and whispered in back rooms, and where anyone—regardless of rank—can blend into the nightly bustle.

## Economy & Activity

By day, Dockshade hums with artisans crafting posters, lanterns and props for the district’s many venues, while street vendors peddle quick bites and curious curiosities to passersby. As dusk falls, playhouses and taverns flood with patrons—from dockhands swapping stories to merchants sealing deals over fine spirits. Music and laughter spill into the streets, where impromptu performances, evening markets and hidden gambling dens cater to every taste. The waterfront promenade, lined with taverns and lounges, remains lively long after the ships have moored, ensuring Dockshade’s economy thrives on a steady tide of entertainment and leisure.

## Inhabitants

Dockshade’s patrons span all walks of life—stout-hearted laborers, fretful merchants, impecunious artists and gilded importers. Performers, bouncers, impresarios and pickpockets mingle freely once the stage lights rise.

## Notable Locations
