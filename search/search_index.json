Please use the guide below, along with the Warlock! Rulebook (starts on page 10) to create your character. Initial Skills In this campaign, you play misfits, outcasts, and opportunists; characters who thrive on the edges of society. Expect to lie, steal, bargain, and survive by wit or blade as you navigate factional strife, criminal underworlds, and fleeting fortunes. Your choices shape your path, though don\u2019t expect heroics; desperate times make desperate people. All characters start with their 32 skills at Level 4 . Then: Raise 10 skills of your choice to Level 6 (representing your character\u2019s strongest innate abilities). Raise another 10 skills of your choice to Level 5 (representing abilities your character is somewhat proficient in). Additional skill points will be awarded after career selection (see next section) Note A few changes to Skills that deviate from the rulebook: Navigation \u2192 Scouting: Scouting covers observing and navigating urban environments: spotting routes, entrances, and casing targets for infiltration and/or escape. Survival \u2192 Street Craft: Street Craft covers practical survival instincts for urban life: evading pursuit, finding shelter,, spotting pickpockets, blending into crowds, among other skills. Unlike Streetwise, Street Craft is about physical actions. Ostler \u2192 Animal Handling: Animal Handling reflects a character\u2019s ability to train, calm, care for, and command animals: from riding horses, quieting guard dogs, guiding trained birds, and similar pursuits. It covers both practical care and intuitive rapport with beasts. Basic Careers Warlock! outlines 24 basic career paths to choose from (with one additional one inserted for this campaign). Players will advance in one primary basic career, eventually adopt a secondary, and then target more advanced (and much improved) careers. Each career provides: 5 career specific skills (indicated by checking the related skill\u2019s first box in your character sheet). Career skills are the only ones that can be improved with Advances ( Warlock!\u2019s leveling mechanic). Each skill has a maximum level, raised by advancing to more specialized careers. Starting equipment Character building prompts: feel free to expand upon or change up your character building prompts Slight changes have been made to the available Basic Careers and their associated Skills. Please reference Basic Careers for more information. Starting equipment and character building prompts can still be found in the Rulebook. After selecting your career, distribute 10 additional skills points across your career skills. Note Starting characters should total 168 skills points across all skills (not counting any additional bonuses from Knacks). Your initial career also sets your Career Skill , equal to your lowest of your five career skills. This is used for miscellaneous checks, improving stamina, and guiding character advancement. Note If your character concept does not fit the existing careers, discuss it with the GM. Some character concepts may not be fully achievable at the start, but can be accommodated in advanced careers. Choosing a Knack Each character begins with a Knack - a unique ability picked up through hard lessons, close calls, or raw instinct. Knacks grant both a small passive benefit that is always in effect, and a limited-use active ability that can be triggered during play. These knacks represent what sets your character apart from the other cutthroats and misfits scraping by in the city\u2019s underbelly. Warning These knacks are homebrewed, and the GM reserves the rights to make small tweaks for balancing reasons during downtime. Please reference Knacks for a full list of available abilities. Filling in the Rest The following are the remaining items that need to be filled into your character sheet: Your character\u2019s name A brief background Your character\u2019s Kin (race). Warning While Kin has no direct mechanical effects, it influences how the world interacts with you. Character Advancement While not strictly related to character creation, the below information is useful for knowing how you will be advancing your character\u2019s path. At the end of each session, Players will be asked a series of questions that will determine the amount of Advancements they will receive. Players can use these Advancements to: Increase a Career Skill by one point (per Advancement spent). Skills may not exceed the level cap set by the Career. Change Career (Page 62) by spending 5 Advances. Advancing a Career (Page 63) by spending 5 Advances.
