# Skill Challenges

This framework adapts DC20’s cinematic “Challenge” mechanic to Warlock!’s flat DC 20 skill-test system. Players still roll d20 + Skill vs. a single Challenge DC, but earn **Success Points (SP)** to drive both individual flair and group outcomes.

## Skill Challenge Workflow

To complete a skill challenge, the four following steps must be followed:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-tune: __GM Sets Parameters__

    ---

    Challenges have two key parameters, borrowed directly from DC20:

    === "Challenge DC"
    
        In _Warlock!_ the basic Skill Check DC remains 20.
    
    === "Success Point Threshold"
        * __Easy__: Number of PCs – 1
        * __Standard__: Number of PCs
        * __Hard__: Number of PCs + 1

-   :material-dice-d20:{ .lg .middle } __Players Make Checks__

    ---

    1.  **Narration**: Each player describes how their PC contributes.
    2.  **Skill Assignment**: GM assigns an appropriate Warlock! Adventuring Skill.
    3.  **Roll**: Player rolls **d20 + Skill Level**.
        - **Basic Skill Test**: succeed on a total of 20 or more (GM may impose –2/–4 for extreme difficulty).
        - **Advantage/Disadvantage** apply normally; GM may waive if situation demands.

-   :fontawesome-solid-list-check: __Tally Successes__

    ---

    Each Check awards SP as follows:

    - **Success** (total ≥ DC): **1 SP**
    - **Critical Success** (natural 20): **+1 SP**
    - **Margin**: +1 SP for each full 5 points above DC
    - **Failure** (total < DC): **0 SP**

-   :material-gavel: __Adjucate Results__

    ---

    The GM then determines the results of the challenge for both the Party as a whole and for each individual based upon their respective rolls.

    === "Individual Outcomes"
    
        - **Success**: SP awarded; may grant a minor boon (information, inspiration, temp HP).
        - **Failure**: No SP; may incur a small penalty (damage, time lost, complication).
    
    === "Group Outcomes"
        Compare the total group SP to the set SP Threshold

        - **Group Success** (SP ≥ Threshold): PCs achieve the goal and earn full rewards.
        - **Group Failure** (SP < Threshold): Challenge falls short—apply setback (damage, next DC +1).

## Additional Rules and Notes

- As players migrate to Advanced Careers, it may become necessary to increase the difficulty of these Challenge checks by 2 or more.
- Even failures should move the story forward; avoid narrative dead-ends.
- __Repeated Checks__: If a PC repeats another’s narrative action **and** uses the same Check, that Check is made with a **\-5** **modifier**. This prevents “me too” tactics and ensures each action in the Challenge remains distinct.
- __Helping Allies__: If a PC wants to assist an ally, they must narratively describe **how** they’re helping **and** make a Check that reflects that help (e.g. “I brace the lever,” Athletics Check). They **do not** grant a Help Die or automatic bonus.

!!! note "The Maths"
    Based on a 4-person Party and a max skill of 12 (basic career):

    | Difficulty | SP Threshold | Success Probability |
    |------------|--------------|---------------------|
    | Easy       | 3            | 85.33%              |
    | Standard   | 4            | 72.24%              |
    | Hard       | 5            | 56.16%              |
