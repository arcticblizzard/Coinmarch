# Envoy’s Rest

**District Type**: Civic

## Summary

Tucked just east of Swordcrest, Envoy’s Rest is Kolnmark’s compact diplomatic quarter. Stately lodges and administrative halls line its narrow avenues, while a shaded woodland park near its edge offers a quiet refuge. Here rival delegations converge, each hoping to secure fresh mercenary support, under the watchful eyes of city guards.

## History & Role

Originally a caravan staging ground for military envoys, Envoy’s Rest was formalized in the last century as Kolnmark’s official diplomatic enclave. As mercenary companies grew into a city-defining force, the district took on added importance: its halls now echo with the arguments of foreign powers, each eager to contract Kolnmark’s famed legionnaires.

## Economy & Activity

Envoy’s Rest thrives on high-stakes negotiation:  
- **Lodging Houses** cater to rival delegations, from gilded suites to austere barracks.  
- **Administrative Bureaus** process contracts, payrolls, and arms-shipment permits.  
- **Mercenary Liaisons** and brokers keep offices open late, matching commanders to coin.  
- **Security Firms** hire out armed escorts and secure meeting rooms for sensitive talks.  
- **Parkside Cafés** and taverns serve as informal salons where clandestine side-deals form.

## Inhabitants

A transient population of envoys, regimental commanders, and contract clerks outnumbers the permanent staff of scribes, interpreters, and guards. Local innkeepers, artisans crafting diplomatic gifts, and park-keepers round out the steady residents—most of whom have seen two opposing delegations arrive on the same morning.

## Notable Locations

- **Concord Park** – A gated, oak-shaded enclave where emissaries meditate between sessions, its winding paths punctuated by open-air pavilions.  
- **Diplomat’s Court** – A pale-stone complex of chancery offices, where scrolls are drawn up, sealed, and dispatched.  
- **The Exchange** – Mercenary brokerages occupy these interconnected townhouses, each representing one of Kolnmark’s famed companies.  
- **Iron Gate Lodge** – The district’s largest hostelry, its twin iron portcullises and cannon-guarded entrance set the tone for martial hospitality.  
- **The Vault of Accordance** – A vaulted, oak-paneled repository adjacent to Diplomat’s Court. Here visiting delegations consult codices of regional law, treaties past and present, and local customaries. Private study alcoves and on-call scribes ensure that envoys can research, translate, and commission exact copies of any document under discreet candlelight.
