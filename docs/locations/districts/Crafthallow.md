# Crafthallow

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

Crafthallow is Kolnmark’s greatest hub of artisans and guilds, occupying the geographic center of the Upper City. Neighboring leisure promenades, civic offices, and grand residences, its streets hum with the forging of metal, the shaping of glass, and the weaving of fabrics. At its heart lies a tree-lined specialty market; beyond that, vast workshops and showrooms define its skyline.

## History & Role

Founded when master‐masons and smiths were summoned to rebuild the city after the Great Calamity, Crafthallow quickly grew into the Kingdom’s premier center of manufacture. Its central location made it a natural meeting point for merchants and magistrates alike—every new invention or luxury good that shaped Kolnmark’s prosperity was first crafted within these walls.

## Economy & Activity

Crafthallow thrives on the production, testing, and commissioning of an endless range of crafted goods. Each morning, caravans transport raw materials—iron ingots, luminescent crystals, exotic textiles—to expansive workshops and guild houses. Throughout the day, guildmasters, city envoys, and mercenary captains convene in appointed chambers to negotiate bulk contracts for weaponry, bespoke armor, and luxury wares destined for nobles and distant markets. Along the district’s arterial avenues, master smiths hammer steel at glowing forges, glasswrights swirl molten glass into crystal goblets, and gearcrafters assemble intricate clockwork mechanisms under vaulted ceilings. In parallel, clerks and apprentices record payrolls, oversee supply chains, and dispatch freshly minted goods to the Specialty Market at the square’s center. From dawn’s first hammer blow to the final tally at dusk, Crafthallow’s workshops and offices orchestrate Kolnmark’s guild economy—fueling both its martial might and its appetite for finery.

## Inhabitants

A teeming population of journeymen, master‐artisans, and guild clerks keeps Crafthallow humming day and night. Apprentices live above their workshops; visiting merchants and diplomats drift through the market square; city representatives dispatch contracts and inspections from the district’s guildhalls.
