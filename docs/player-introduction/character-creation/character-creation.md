## Initial Skills

In this campaign, you play misfits, outcasts, and opportunists; characters who thrive on the edges of society. Expect to lie, steal, bargain, and survive by wit or blade as you navigate factional strife, criminal underworlds, and fleeting fortunes. Your choices shape your path, though don’t expect heroics; desperate times make desperate people.

All characters start with their 32 skills at **Level 4**. Then:

- Raise **10** skills of your choice to **Level 6** (representing your character’s strongest innate abilities).
- Raise another **10** skills of your choice to **Level 5** (representing abilities your character is somewhat proficient in).
- Additional skill points will be awarded after career selection (see next section)

!!! note "Skill Changes"

    A few changes to Skills that deviate from the rulebook:
    
    - **Navigation** → **Scouting:** Scouting covers observing and navigating urban environments: spotting routes, entrances, and casing targets for infiltration and/or escape.
    - **Survival → Street Craft:** Street Craft covers practical survival instincts for urban life: evading pursuit, finding shelter,, spotting pickpockets, blending into crowds, among other skills. Unlike Streetwise, Street Craft is about physical actions.
    - **Ostler → Animal Handling:** Animal Handling reflects a character’s ability to train, calm, care for, and command animals: from riding horses, quieting guard dogs, guiding trained birds, and similar pursuits. It covers both practical care and intuitive rapport with beasts.

## Basic Careers

_Warlock!_ outlines 24 basic career paths to choose from (with one additional one inserted for this campaign). Players will advance in one primary basic career, eventually adopt a secondary, and then target more advanced (and much improved) careers. Each career provides:

- 5 career specific skills (indicated by checking the related skill’s first box in your character sheet).
    - Career skills are the **only** ones that can be improved with Advances (_Warlock!’s_ leveling mechanic).
    - Each skill has a maximum level, raised by advancing to more specialized careers.
- Starting equipment
- Character building prompts: feel free to expand upon or change up your character building prompts

Slight changes have been made to the available Basic Careers and their associated Skills. Please reference [Basic Careers](/Coinmarch/player-introduction/character-creation/basic-careers/) for more information. Starting equipment and character building prompts can still be found in the Rulebook.

After selecting your career, distribute **10 additional skills points** across your career skills.

!!! note "Starting Skill Total"

    Starting characters should total **168 skills points** across all skills (not counting any additional bonuses from Knacks).

Your initial career also sets your **Career Skill**, equal to your **lowest** of your five career skills. This is used for miscellaneous checks, improving stamina, and guiding character advancement.

!!! note "Custom Carrers"

    If your character concept does not fit the existing careers, discuss it with the GM. Some character concepts may not be fully achievable at the start, but can be accommodated in advanced careers.

## Choosing a Knack

Each character begins with a Knack - a unique ability picked up through hard lessons, close calls, or raw instinct. Knacks grant both a small **passive** benefit that is always in effect, and a limited-use **active** **ability** that can be triggered during play. These knacks represent what sets your character apart from the other cutthroats and misfits scraping by in the city’s underbelly.

The passive ability of a knack may *exceed* the skill cap set out by your basic career.

!!! warning "GM Fiat"

    These knacks are homebrewed, and the GM reserves the rights to make small tweaks for balancing reasons during downtime.

Please reference [Knacks](/Coinmarch/player-introduction/character-creation/knacks/) for a full list of available abilities.

## Filling in the Rest

The following are the remaining items that need to be filled into your character sheet:

- Your character’s name
- A brief background
- Your character’s Kin (race).
    
!!! note "No Race Mechanics"
    While Kin has no direct mechanical effects, it influences how the world interacts with you.

## Character Advancement

While not strictly related to character creation, the below information is useful for knowing how you will be advancing your character’s path.

At the end of each session, Players will be asked a series of questions that will determine the amount of Advancements they will receive.

Players can use these Advancements to:

- Increase a **Career Skill** by one point (per Advancement spent). Skills may not exceed the level cap set by the Career.
- Change Career (Page 62) by spending **5** Advances.
- Advancing a Career (Page 63) by spending **5** Advances.
    
!!! warning "Additional Requirements"
    There are additional requirements that must be met for the selection of an Advanced Career, outlined on Page 63.
