# Eastmere

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

Eastmere sits between the High Road and the sheer cliffs overlooking the Blade Sea, just inside the East Gate. Its winding lanes lead from a bustling square south of the gate up toward a row of grand cliff-top residences. Eastmere is prized by the city’s elite who seek both easy access to the High Road and sweeping sea vistas.

## History & Role

Originally a fishing hamlet clustered atop the cliffs, Eastmere was annexed as Kolnmark expanded eastward. Its proximity to the East Gate made it a natural home for officials, merchants, and minor nobility. Over time, modest cottages gave way to stately manors; today, Eastmere blends civic pride with private luxury, its coastline defined by both public parks and patrician estates.

## Economy & Activity

Eastmere thrives on private patronage and civic functions:  
- **Government & Administration**: The Eastmere Civic Pavilion hosts municipal courts and harbor oversight, while its rear gardens serve as a gathering place.  
- **Patrician Society**: Wealthy families maintain cliff-top manors and employ households of stewards, gardeners, and clerks.  
- **Local Services**: Craftsmen and shopkeepers along the High Road cater to gate-traffic—inns, tailors, and provisioners benefit from both travelers and residents.  
- **Shrine Tourism**: The Shrine Terrace Park draws small pilgrimages to its ancient oratories dedicated to the Old Gods.

## Inhabitants

A population of civil servants, patrician families, and their retainers forms the permanent community. Domestic staff, gardeners, and clerks outnumber residents three to one. Daytime East Gate traffic adds a steady influx of merchants, bureaucrats, and visiting dignitaries.

## Notable Locations

- **Cliffhaven Estate** – A soaring white-stone manor clinging to the northern cliffs, its terraced gardens tumble toward the sea, planted with wind-tolerant pines and roses.  
- **Opaline Rotunda** – North of the gate square, this domed, winged hall of pale granite seats the district’s magistrates; broad steps descend to a formal garden and reflecting pool open to all.  
- **House of Varindale** – Raised on a broad crepidoma, this twin-winged manor features Ionic columns, marble balustrades, and a raised fountain courtyard.  
- **Patrician Hall of Unity** – Along the High Road near Velvet Court, this vaulted meeting hall hosts noble assemblies, ambassadorial receptions, and contract negotiations among the city’s great families.  
- **Shrine Terrace Park** – A cliff-edge grove of circular pavilions and chapels honoring the Old Gods, each set amid sheltered niches and carved stone benches.  
- **Tideholm House** – A smaller, twin-manor complex midway down the cliffs, its paired pavilions flank a formal koi pond accompanied by the sea breeze.
