# Coinmarch Campaign Frame

>“In Coinmarch, every shadow hides a secret… and every secret has its price.”

## The Pitch

Coinmarch’s sun-bleached spires soar above the Blade Sea, gleaming by day with the promise of wealth and power. But when the sun dips below the horizon, the city’s true heart comes alive—an ever-shifting web of back-alley deals, guild rivalries, and hidden whispers that echo through the ancient Middens below. Last week, one of the city’s richest merchant-princes was found dead in his private gallery—his treasures gone, his blood spilt by sorcery. Now suspicion coils through every district: watchmen tighten their patrols, guild bosses whisper betrayals in shadowed courtyards, and every scrap of information is worth more than its weight in gold. You arrive at this crossroads of light and shadow, where every lock you pick and every secret you unearth could turn the city’s fortunes… or seal your own fate.

## Overview
Coinmarch is a sprawling maritime metropolis carved into white-limestone cliffs beside the Blade Sea. Its sunlit plazas shimmer with merchant caravans and ornate guildhalls, while narrow streets below teem with bright bazaars, clandestine thieves’ dens, and the ever-present gloom of the Middens—the ancient underground labyrinth that underpins every district. Magic is rare, viewed with suspicion, and those who wield it walk a precarious line between reverence and persecution.

You and your crew are a handpicked band of opportunists, specialists, and misfits—each drawn by the promise of gold, the thrill of discovery, or a debt only Coinmarch can settle. Together you form a loose fellowship: rogues who slip unseen through moonlit rooftops; informants who trade dangerous secrets in hushed tones; and outcasts who know every hidden passage in the city’s underbelly.

Your purpose is simple and flexible: carve out your own fortunes and forge your own legends. Perhaps you’ll liberate locked vaults, broker alliances between rival guilds, or delve into the Middens in search of forgotten relics. The specifics are yours to decide—but rest assured: in a city built on commerce and conspiracy, your ambitions will shape Kolnmark’s future… or see you swallowed by its shadows.

## Communities
Coinmarch is a thriving port city of roughly 50,000 souls, where every race and station of life converges beneath the same sky. From the sun-washed spires of the Upper City to the bustling markets and shadowed alleys of the Lower City, and down into the winding tunnels of the Midden, each tier tells a different story. Above, marble facades and gilded balconies speak of wealth and influence; below, crowded streets and hidden bazaars hum with ambition and survival; and beneath it all, the ancient stone corridors of the Midden pulse with secret histories and untold dangers.

=== "Upper City"

    Perched atop the white cliffs, Upper Kolnmark is the city’s rarified summit—where marble halls, noble estates and grand plazas reflect the sun’s first light.

=== "Lower City"

    Lower Kolnmark is the bustling lower city tucked between the river and the towering causeway. Its winding streets host everything from busy wharves and markets to cramped tenements and shadowy alleys.

=== "Middens"

    The Middens are the vast, ancient catacombs that thread beneath Kolnmark’s streets—once the foundations of past settlements, now a shifting maze of stone corridors, collapsed vaults, and hidden alcoves. By day they serve smugglers, thieves, and secret societies as clandestine highways; by night they teem with forgotten traps and creatures born in darkness. Every echo in those tunnels carries both the promise of long-buried riches and the peril of never finding your way back.

## Ancestries and Classes

=== "Ancestries"

    Coinmarch is one of the most progressive cities on the Blade Sea: all are welcome to feed the machines of war - be they bold, broken, or desparate.

    - Humans
    - Elves
    - Dwarves
    - Halflings

=== "Classes"

    Kolnmark welcomes adventurers of every calling—choose whichever class speaks to you, but note that those whose roles normally serve law or station will need a compelling fall from grace to walk these streets.

    Your journey begins with a Basic Career, reflecting the skills and experiences that shaped your early life. As the story unfolds and your reputation grows, you’ll advance into a Second Career, building on your strengths or exploring a new path. Eventually, you’ll unlock the opportunity to pursue a Specialized Career—a prestigious, high-tier role that represents your character’s mastery, unique talents, and place within Coinmarch’s shifting power structure.
