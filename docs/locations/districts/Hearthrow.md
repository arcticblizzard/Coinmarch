# Hearthrow

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

A broad swath of lower-city living bounded by the eastern banks of the Koln River, the main east–west thoroughfare to the north, the Greenwold to the east, and the old city wall to the south. Hearthrow’s tree-lined streets accommodate elegant riverside villas, sturdy middle-class homes, and clustered tenements—one of the lower city’s largest residential quarters.

## History & Role

Originally farmland outside the old walls, Hearthrow was annexed as Kolnmark expanded westward. Grand riverbank estates sprung up first, followed by craftsmen’s houses and tenements for laborers. Today it balances genteel riverside living with the bustle of working-class neighborhoods, bridging Greenwold’s leisure with Gatefold’s commerce.

## Economy & Activity

Hearthrow thrives on a blend of domestic life and local trade. A modest market near the southern wall supplies both Hearthrow and neighboring Gatefold with produce, cloth, and sundries. Small boutique workshops line the northern and riverside avenues, while riverside ferrymen and Greenwold visitors pass through daily. Amidst the quiet, the hum of workshop hammers and children’s laughter lend constant life.

## Inhabitants

A mixed‐income populace calls Hearthrow home: prosperous merchants and mid‐level artisans in well-kept homes, alongside families eking out space in brick tenements. Retired civil servants and riverside widows share sidewalks with apprentice coopers, seamstresses, and day-laborers. Neighbors tend front gardens or simply lean on railings to watch the river’s flow.

## Notable Locations

- **Riverside Promenade** – A shaded stone walkway along the Koln’s eastern bank, where river breeze cools grand homes and ferry landings alike.  
- **Hearthrow Market** – Tucked against the old city wall, this compact square hosts stalls of fresh produce, yard goods, and everyday wares—open dawn to dusk.  
- **Tenement Court** – A tight courtyard of brick-faced lodging for Hearthrow’s working families. Laundry sways overhead and children play around its central well.  
- **Boutique Row** – A narrow lane of shuttered shopfronts selling fine leatherwork, hand-blown glass, and bespoke millinery—serving the district’s middle classes.
- **Willowbank Manor** – A graceful stone-and-ivy estate set on terraced lawns that slope down to the Koln’s eastern bank. Built by the venerable Elwood family, its arched windows and wrought-iron balustrades catch every sunset over the river.  
- **Riverview Hall** – A pillared red-brick manor crowned with slate turrets and overlooking the ferry landing. Its long colonnaded veranda serves afternoon teas, while crystal lanterns glow across the river at dusk.  
- **Greenwold Pavilion** – A light-filled, glass-fronted lounge nestled where Hearthrow meets the Greenwold. Ornate trellises of climbing roses frame arched doors onto the park, and weekends find musicians and dancers entertaining beneath its vaulted roof.
