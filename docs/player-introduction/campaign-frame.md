# Coinmarch Campaign Frame

>“In Coinmarch, every shadow hides a secret… and every secret has its price.”

## The Pitch

Coinmarch’s sun-bleached spires rise over the Blade Sea, gleaming by day with the promise of wealth and influence. But when night falls, the city’s true face emerges—an intricate web of back-alley bargains, simmering guild rivalries, and whispers that slither through the ancient Middens below. For weeks now, people have been disappearing—dockside laborers, guild apprentices, even scions of noble blood—vanishing without a trace. Rumors swirl of a new and dangerous power moving in the shadows: the Cult of the Undine. Fear coils through every district as watchmen tighten patrols and desperate guildmasters hire blades to keep their houses safe. In this tense and shifting cityscape, every secret you uncover, every lock you pick, and every risk you take could earn you a fortune… or drag you under with the rest of the lost.

## Overview
Coinmarch is a sprawling maritime metropolis carved into white-limestone cliffs beside the Blade Sea. Its sunlit plazas shimmer with merchant caravans and ornate guildhalls, while narrow streets below teem with bright bazaars, clandestine thieves’ dens, and the ever-present gloom of the Middens—the ancient underground labyrinth that underpins every district. Magic is rare, viewed with suspicion, and those who wield it walk a precarious line between reverence and persecution.

You and your crew are a handpicked band of opportunists, specialists, and misfits—each drawn by the promise of gold, the thrill of discovery, or a debt only Coinmarch can settle. Together you form a loose fellowship: rogues who slip unseen through moonlit rooftops; informants who trade dangerous secrets in hushed tones; and outcasts who know every hidden passage in the city’s underbelly.

Your purpose is simple and flexible: carve out your own fortunes and forge your own legends. Perhaps you’ll liberate locked vaults, broker alliances between rival guilds, or delve into the Middens in search of forgotten relics. The specifics are yours to decide—but rest assured: in a city built on commerce and conspiracy, your ambitions will shape Coinmarch’s future… or see you swallowed by its shadows.

## Communities
Coinmarch is a thriving port city of roughly 50,000 souls, where every race and station of life converges beneath the same sky. From the sun-washed spires of the Upper City to the bustling markets and shadowed alleys of the Lower City, and down into the winding tunnels of the Midden, each tier tells a different story. Above, marble facades and gilded balconies speak of wealth and influence; below, crowded streets and hidden bazaars hum with ambition and survival; and beneath it all, the ancient stone corridors of the Middens pulse with secret histories and untold dangers.

=== "Upper City"

    Perched atop the white cliffs, Upper Kolnmark is the city’s rarified summit—where marble halls, noble estates and grand plazas reflect the sun’s first light.

=== "Lower City"

    Lower Kolnmark is the bustling lower city tucked between the river and the towering causeway. Its winding streets host everything from busy wharves and markets to cramped tenements and shadowy alleys.

=== "Middens"

    The Middens are the vast, ancient catacombs that thread beneath Coinmarch’s streets—once the foundations of past settlements, now a shifting maze of stone corridors, collapsed vaults, and hidden alcoves. By day they serve smugglers, thieves, and secret societies as clandestine highways; by night they teem with forgotten traps and creatures born in darkness. Every echo in those tunnels carries both the promise of long-buried riches and the peril of never finding your way back.

## Ancestries and Classes

=== "Ancestries"

    Coinmarch is one of the most progressive cities on the Blade Sea: all are welcome to feed the machines of war - be they bold, broken, or desparate.

    - Humans
    - Elves
    - Dwarves
    - Halflings

=== "Classes"

    Coinmarch welcomes adventurers of every calling—choose whichever class speaks to you, but note that those whose roles normally serve law or station will need a compelling fall from grace to walk these streets.

    Your journey begins with a Basic Career, reflecting the skills and experiences that shaped your early life. As the story unfolds and your reputation grows, you’ll advance into a Second Career, building on your strengths or exploring a new path. Eventually, you’ll unlock the opportunity to pursue a Specialized Career—a prestigious, high-tier role that represents your character’s mastery, unique talents, and place within Coinmarch’s shifting power structure.

    __A Note About Magic:__ Magic in Coinmarch is tightly regulated: all scrolls are to be registered and embossed with the official seal of the City. Any scroll found without the seal is confiscated, and its holder set to face steep consequences. Those with predilictions towards magic are generally distrusted and if caught weilding unlicensed magic are either exiled or conscripted into an eager mercenary company's magical regiment.

## Session Zero Questions

When you choose your Basic Career, you’ll receive prompts to help shape your backstory—where you came from, who you were, and what brought you here. Feel free to answer those directly or craft your own spin. In addition, every character should answer these universal questions to anchor them in Coinmarch’s streets, its factions, and its rising tensions.

1. **What first brought you to Coinmarch—and why haven’t you left?**
2. **Whose trust have you earned in the city, and whose trust have you broken?**
3. **What do you fear most about the Middens, and why do you still go below?**
4. **What’s the one thing you can’t afford to lose—and who knows about it?**
5. **When whispers of the missing began, how did it touch your life—or the life of someone close to you?**
