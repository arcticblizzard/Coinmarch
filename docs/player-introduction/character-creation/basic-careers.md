# Basic Careers

In lieu of Players rolling to build a random list of basic careers to choose from during character creation, they have been categorized into five groups of five; each group representing an archetype found in a fantasy-themed criminal underworld. Players should each choose an archetype, and then choose the career that best fits their character idea. There have been some slight tweaks to skills and careers (noted below).
