<h1 id="kolnmark">Kolnmark</h1>
<h2 id="overview-history">Overview &amp; History</h2>
<p>Coinmarch occupies a strategic perch at the mouth of the River Koln on the northern edge of the Blade Sea. In its earliest days it bore the name <strong>Kolnmark</strong>, home to a vast causeway and castle that stretched from the white cliffs out into the waters—an engineering marvel unmatched in scale and wonder. That mighty bridge and fortification was shattered in some long-forgotten calamity, its stones cast into the deep. From the ruins of old Kolnmark another city arose: today’s Coinmarch.</p>
<p><img alt="Panorama of Coinmarch" src="/Coinmarch/images/kolnmark_panorama.jpg" /></p>
<p>The modern city is cleaved in two by those same white cliffs—the bustling <a href="/Coinmarch/locations/LowerKolnmark">Lower City</a> hugging the riverbanks below, and the grand <a href="/Coinmarch/locations/UpperKolnmark">Upper City</a>  crowned atop the bluffs. They are joined only by the sloping thoroughfare called the Cleft, which winds its way between merchant stalls below to marble-paved avenues above. Coinmarch has defined itself as the world’s premier home for mercenary companies, whose captains and commanders both live and do business here. Though the lands beyond are racked by endless war, none dare besiege the city that supplies the blade for every battle. In Coinmarch, conflict is currency—and its elite grow inexorably richer upon that strife.</p>

<h2 id="lower-kolnmark">Lower Kolnmark</h2>
<p>Lower Kolnmark is the bustling lower city tucked between the river and the towering causeway. Its winding streets host everything from busy wharves and markets to cramped tenements and shadowy alleys.</p>
<h3 id="bargebreaker-island">Bargebreaker Island</h3>
<p>A soot-blackened, craggy island nestled in the mouth of the Koln River, Bargebreaker Island connects the East and West banks of Kolnmark via the Blackspans—two ancient stone bridges, darkened by generations of coal smoke. A place of industry and consequence, the island has a reputation as black as its buildings. 
<a href="/Coinmarch/locations/districts/Bargebreaker_Island">More info</a></p>
<h3 id="breakbay-docks">Breakbay Docks</h3>
<p>An expansive waterfront district hugging the deep, sheltered waters of Breakbay. As Kolnmark’s principal deep-water port, it bustles with the largest ocean-going vessels, surrounded by cranes, warehouses, and the shipping offices that keep regional trade moving. 
<a href="/Coinmarch/locations/districts/Breakbay_Docks">More info</a></p>
<h3 id="callus-run">Callus Run</h3>
<p>A bustling arc of workshops and storefronts along the north edge of Kolnmark’s lower-city thoroughfare, Callus Run stretches from the foot of the Blackspans to the fringe of Greenwold.
