# Bannercrest

**District Type**: Civic

## Summary

Sitting at the northernmost promontory of Upper Kolnmark, Bannercrest is the city’s seat of power. Its white stone halls and ramparts crown the cliffs, gazing out over the Blade Sea. Here the lords and commons convene, justice is meted out, and the city’s highest offices are housed.

## History & Role

Bannercrest was founded on the ruins of an ancient coastal fortress, claimed by Kolnmark’s founders for its natural defensibility and sweeping sea views. Over centuries it grew into the political heart of the city, its twin chambers—the Hall of Lords and Hall of Commons—shaping laws, levying taxes, and guiding Kolnmark through peace and war alike.

## Economy & Activity

Bannercrest’s bustle is driven by governance rather than trade:  
- Voting sessions in the Commons draw artisans, merchants, and petitioners to lobby for statutes.  
- The Hall of Lords entertains foreign envoys and ratifies mercenary charters that fund the city’s defenses.  
- The Grand Courthouse processes high-profile trials, attracting scribes, jurists, and onlookers.  
- Administrative clerks and tax collectors maintain vaulted records and ledgers in secure archives.  
- Barracks within the Northern Bastion quarter train the City Guard and house contingents of the Stormfleet.

## Inhabitants

A dense population of magistrates, councilors, jurists, clerks, and their retainers occupies Bannercrest. Members of the minor nobility and visiting ambassadors dwell in elegant townhouses near the chambers. Ever-present are the City Guard patrols and the bannered standard-bearers of Kolnmark’s governor.

## Notable Locations

- **Hall of Lords** – A lofty marble chamber ringed with carved banners, where the city’s patrician families debate edicts under vaulted frescoes.  
- **Hall of Commons** – A more modest, plank-floored hall for elected delegates; its benches creak with the voices of merchants, gildsmen, and ward representatives.  
- **Grand Courthouse** – A domed basilica of justice, its judges’ dais overlooks a tribunal floor where even the mightiest may stand accused.  
- **The Great Seat** – A strongly fortified keep at the cliff’s tip, encircled by high curtain walls and moats. It serves as the governor’s residence, emergency stronghold, and secure archive for the city’s most sensitive records.  
- **Westwatch Tower** – A slender lighthouse-like spire on the western cliff edge, its beacon guides incoming ships and signals across Kolnmark’s defenses.
