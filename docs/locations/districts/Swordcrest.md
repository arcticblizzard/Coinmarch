# Swordcrest

**District Type**: Martial

## Summary

Situated on the northern edge of Upper Kolnmark, Swordcrest is the Kingdom’s premier martial district. It adjoins the Giant’s Causeway—vast parade grounds for daily drills and grand tournaments—and revolves around a central eight-spoked rotunda that houses the commanders of the city’s foremost mercenary companies.

## History & Role

Originally established as a fortified lookout over the Causeway, Swordcrest grew into a hub for contract soldiers and warband leaders. Over centuries the scattered training fields coalesced into a formal martial quarter, where warlords and captains convene to set the terms of service and display their prowess.

## Economy & Activity

Swordcrest’s economy is driven by every facet of warfare and martial support:  
- **Mercenary Command**: Eight major companies maintain offices and war-chests in the central rotunda, negotiating contracts and overseeing strikes.  
- **Arms & Armor Workshops**: Smiths, cuirassiers, and fletchers line the streets, producing weapons, plate mail, and siege engines.  
- **Training Grounds**: The Giant’s Causeway hosts daily barracks drills, mock sieges, and annual tourneys that draw crowds and bettors.  
- **Dignitary Hospitality**: Inns and guildhalls cater to visiting emissaries and nobles in the Viewing Hall, who come to oversee maneuvers and secure alliances.

## Inhabitants

A rugged population of veteran soldiers, drill sergeants, and campaign-season artisans. Commanders and recruiters in ornate garb share crowded taverns with hardened trainers, armor-crafters, and foreign envoys. Civilians are few, limited to armorers’ families and tavern-keepers.

## Notable Locations

- **The Octal Rotunda** – A great circular hall divided by eight radial corridors, each devoted to one of the city’s leading mercenary companies. Command councils and contract signings take place beneath its vaulted dome.  
- **Giant’s Causeway Parade Grounds** – A sweeping expanse of crushed stone rings by low stone walls, used daily for formation drills, mounted charges, and gladiatorial displays.  
- **The Clang** – A narrow street of interlinked workshops where master smiths forge swords, siege hammers, and intricately tooled pikes to outfit entire companies.  
- **Ledger Hall** – A fortified complex of vaulted chambers and brass-bound ledgers, Ledger Hall serves as the administrative heart for Swordcrest’s companies. Inside, clerks in tabard-lined cubicles pore over muster rolls, negotiate contract amendments, and process payroll requisitions. A vast rotating ledger wheel in the central chamber displays every active hire, payment schedule, and obligation—ensuring captains, recruiters, and quartermasters keep their companies in service and fully supplied.  
- **Viewing Hall** – A raised pavilion of glass and steel overlooking the Causeway. Foreign diplomats and highborn patrons watch live demonstrations of tactics before negotiating contracts over lavious drinks and meals.
