# Skill Challenges

This framework adapts DC20’s cinematic “Challenge” mechanic to Warlock!’s flat DC 20 skill-test system. Players still roll d20 + Skill vs. a single Challenge DC, but earn **Success Points (SP)** to drive both individual flair and group outcomes.

## 1. GM Sets Parameters

Challenges have two key parameters, borrowed directly from DC20:

### 1.1 Challenge DC

In _Warlock!_ the basic Skill Check DC remains 20.

!!! note "Note"

    As players migrate to Advanced Careers, it may become necessary to increase the difficulty of these Challenge checks by 2 or more.


### 1.2 Success Point Threshold

- **Easy**: Number of PCs – 1
- **Standard**: Number of PCs
- **Hard**: Number of PCs + 1

---

## 2. PCs Make Checks

1.  **Narration**: Each player describes how their PC contributes.
2.  **Skill Assignment**: GM assigns an appropriate Warlock! Adventuring Skill.
3.  **Roll**: Player rolls **d20 + Skill Level**.
    - **Basic Skill Test**: succeed on a total of 20 or more (GM may impose –2/–4 for extreme difficulty).
    - **Advantage/Disadvantage** apply normally; GM may waive if situation demands.

## 3. Success Points Earned

Each Check awards SP as follows:

- **Success** (total ≥ DC): **1 SP**
- **Critical Success** (natural 20): **+1 SP**
- **Margin**: +1 SP for each full 5 points above DC
- **Failure** (total < DC): **0 SP**

## 4. Adjudicating Results

### 4.1 Individual Outcomes

- **Success**: SP awarded; may grant a minor boon (information, inspiration, temp HP).
- **Failure**: No SP; may incur a small penalty (damage, time lost, complication).

### 4.2 Group Outcome

- **Total SP** vs. **Threshold**:
    - **Group Success** (SP ≥ Threshold): PCs achieve the goal and earn full rewards.
    - **Group Failure** (SP < Threshold): Challenge falls short—apply setback (damage, next DC +1).

!!! note "Note"

    _Even failures should move the story forward; avoid narrative dead-ends._

!!! note "The Maths"
    Based on a 4-person Party and a max skill of 12 (basic career):

    | Difficulty | SP Threshold | Success Probability |
    |------------|--------------|---------------------|
    | Easy       | 3            | 85.33%              |
    | Standard   | 4            | 72.24%              |
    | Hard       | 5            | 56.16%              |

## 5. Additional Rules

### 5.1 Repeated Checks

If a PC repeats another’s narrative action **and** uses the same Check, that Check is made with a **\-5** **modifier**. This prevents “me too” tactics and ensures each action in the Challenge remains distinct.

### 5.2 Helping Allies

If a PC wants to assist an ally, they must narratively describe **how** they’re helping **and** make a Check that reflects that help (e.g. “I brace the lever,” Athletics Check). They **do not** grant a Help Die or automatic bonus.
