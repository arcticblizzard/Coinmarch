# Caskside

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

A bustling artisan quarter on the western bank of the Koln River, Caskside rose up when Kolnmark spilled beyond its old walls.  Its heartbeat is cooperage—barrel-making for beer, wine and spirits—and the breweries, distilleries, and cellars that crowd its narrow lanes.  The Caskside Docks handle the inflow of specialty goods and the outflow of premier potables, making this district the city’s craft and liquid-export hub.

## History & Role

Originally little more than riverbank scrub and iron-forges, Caskside exploded in growth when Kolnmark’s shipyards pushed the city’s frontier west.  Brewers, distillers and coopers flocked here for space and easy access to lumber being floated down the River Koln.  Over decades it became the city’s de facto “barrel district,” where every tavern’s cask was born—and most never left.  

## Economy & Activity

- **Cooperage**: Master cooperies line Barrelmaker’s Row, churning out oak staves by the ton.  
- **Brewing & Distilling**: Steam-heated mash houses and charcoal-fired stills send plumes of smoke skyward.  
- **River Trade**: Specialty goods arrive by barge; finished casks ship out across the Blade Sea and upriver.  

## Inhabitants

Few call Caskside “home” beyond the coopers’ clans and the brewer’s unions.  Barrel-maids, mash-rakers, log-drivers and riverfolk mix with shifty middlemen in soot-blackened cloaks.  Guards of the Barrelmasters’ Guild patrol the wharves to keep logjams and smugglers in check.

## Notable Locations

- **Caskside Docks** – A tangle of piers and warehouses where loaded barges wait at all hours.  
- **Master Cooper’s Hall** – The guild’s stone-hewn lodge, ringed with staves drying on outdoor racks.  
- **Iron Stave Distillery** – Brass pipes hiss and copper stills glow beneath a cloud of sweet steam.  
- **Barrelmasters’ Plaza** – Open-air market where coopers auction off the finest casks at dawn.
- **The Rare Sip** – A newly-opened taphouse that debuts experimental local spirits, barrel-aged ales, and boutique wines straight from the cooper’s trade.  Its smoky-oak interior and nightly tastings draw connoisseurs citywide.
- **Bridgehead Tavern** – Nestled at the foot of the western Blackspan bridge, this lively inn is famed for its riverside view and nightly “Bridge Barrel” tastings—experimental casks brought straight from Caskside’s cooperies.
- **The Stave & Straw** – A no-frills flophouse tucked nestled next to the outwer wall. For a handful of coppers, local coopers, log-drivers and mash-house hands secure a plank bed and a straw sack—but the lingering tang of fermenting grain promises little in the way of peaceful slumber.
