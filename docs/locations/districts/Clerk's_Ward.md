# Clerk’s Ward

**District Type**: Civic

## Summary

A compact enclave anchoring Kolnmark’s lower city core, Clerk’s Ward faces the broad boulevards and the leafy expanse of the Greenwold. At its heart stands the walled Hall of Records—a stately courtyarded complex where public ledgers, charters, and petitions are filed and reviewed. Here the pulse of daily civic life beats in the shuffle of parchment and the measured steps of robed clerks.

## History & Role

Originally a riverside square for market petitions, Clerk’s Ward evolved as the city’s growth demanded a dedicated civic quarter. Generations of administrators added wings and fortified walls around the original registry chambers, creating today’s Hall of Records. Though real seat of government rests above, this ward manages all the lower city’s permits, disputes, and public archives.

## Economy & Activity

With few shops or taverns, Clerk’s Ward thrives on bureaucracy: line after line of scribes, tax assessors, and petition clerks. Vendors catering to long queueing—ink merchants, quill sellers, and tented tea-stalls—flourish around the Hall’s gates. Occasional street orators and pamphleteers crowd its square, hoping to sway public petitions before the Recorders.

## Inhabitants

A tightly knit community of scribes, junior clerks, and their families, Clerk’s Ward feels almost monastic. Stone-faced city ushers and archivists in crimson-trimmed robes patrol corridors, while petitioners from across the lower city shuffle through courtyards. Outside the walls, small vendors and tea-sellers ply their trade to anchored visitors.

## Notable Locations

- **Hall of Records** – A gated, walled complex with columned porticos opening onto a central courtyard. Here contested deeds, civic petitions, and lower-city permits are filed, indexed, and archived in endless vellum volumes.
- **Quill & Ink Emporium** – A narrow, gorgeously appointed shop at the Greenwold corner, where fine goose-quills and imported inks are weighed and sold by the dram to every weary clerk.
- **Parchment Rest** – A shaded tea pavilion in the Hall’s courtyard, where petitioners sip spiced herbal blends while they wait for their names to be called.
- **Ledger Lane** – A short cobbled alley lined with small stamp dealers, seal-carvers, and petition-drafters—essential support trades for anyone navigating the Ward’s bureaucracy.
