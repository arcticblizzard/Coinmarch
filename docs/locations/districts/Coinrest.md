# Coinrest

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

Coinrest is a spacious, elegant residential quarter nestled between the leafy expanse of the Greenwold to the northwest and the towering silhouette of the Spire to the southeast. Renowned for its stately homes and quiet avenues, it is home to the city’s clergy and master artisans.

## History & Role

Originally laid out as an extension of the Spire’s temple precincts, Coinrest evolved into a coveted neighborhood for the city’s well-to-do. Generous plot sizes and proximity to the great tower attracted prelates, scholars, and craftsmen alike. Its broad streets and walled gardens served as a model for later lower-city expansions.

## Economy & Activity

Though primarily residential, Coinrest supports a handful of specialized workshops and shops that cater to the Spire and its households. Silversmiths craft ceremonial chalices, porcelain painters decorate sacred tiles, and saddle-makers produce ornate harnesses for the temple’s processions. Every dawn, small flower stands and baker’s carts line the quieter lanes, supplying fresh goods to manor kitchens.

## Inhabitants

Clergy of rank and their families fill the large homes. Master artisans—illuminators, icon-makers, metalworkers—dwell in combined home-studios. A discreet coterie of attendants, tutors, and minor clerics occupy the annexes and mews behind each mansion. Evenings in Coinrest are hushed, broken only by distant bell-tolls.

## Notable Locations

- **Trinity Hall** – A triangular service center at the Spire’s lower entrance, housing the Spire’s administrative offices, a clerical registry, and a small public chapel; its three wings converge on a central atrium where aid and counsel are offered to pilgrims and city servants.
- **Silver Court** – Four stately town-homes arranged around a cobblestone courtyard, where clipped hedges hide iron-bound presses used by local guild-artisans.  
- **The Roundhouse** – A circular pavilion on the district’s West flank, its marble colonnade opening onto the Greenwold for morning devotions.  
- **Portico Manor** – A large square mansion topped by a grand portico overlooking the northern gardens; once a private retreat for the Archbishop, now used for formal receptions.  
- **Spirewright’s Forge** – A modest brick workshop near the Spire’s outer gate where master blacksmiths forge the iron fittings and brass inlays used in the tower’s doors and bells.  
- **Acolyte’s Apothecary** – A half-timbered shop set into a row of clerical cottages, offering scented oils, blessed incense, and simple remedies to priests and visitors.
