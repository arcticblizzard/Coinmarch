# The Stumble

**District Type**: Leisure

## Summary

A cramped, rowdy leisure quarter wedged between Breakbay Docks and Garrison Row, The Stumble caters almost exclusively to the city’s hired swords. Cheap lodgings, boisterous taverns, and back-alley diversions draw mercenaries off duty into its lantern-lit streets.

## History & Role

Born in the shadow of the docks and barracks, The Stumble grew up around the Oath House—once a simple mustering point for contract troops, now a sprawling multi-winged hall. As mercenary companies clustered nearby, inns, markets, and gaming dens proliferated to meet every need of the hired blade.

## Economy & Activity

Daylight sees swordsmen bargaining for rations and gear at the northern market stalls. By dusk, dice clatter in cramped taverns, brawls erupt over spilled ale, and knife-throwing contests light up courtyard walls. Coin changes hands fast—on contracts, on drinks, on wagers.

## Inhabitants

Rough-hewn men and women sworn to steel:  
- **Steelhawks**, **Black Banner**, and **Crimson Vultures** rotate through The Stumble’s taverns.  
- Market stall-keepers hawk dried meats, gambling trinkets, and cheap healing salves.  
- A handful of merchants ply exotic wares stolen or smuggled in from the docks.  

## Notable Locations

- **The Oath House** – A vast, multi-winged building with a central courtyard. Company banners line its halls, where mercenary captains sign contracts and share muster fees.  
- **The Twist** – A tight cluster of wooden stalls at the district’s north edge. Vendors sell crusty bread, bartered armor scraps, and all-night gaming tables.  
- **The Broken Barrel Tavern** – A low-ceilinged dive with chipped tables and sour ale. Knife-throwing boards line the back wall, and coin-hungry barkeeps settle disputes with ale-soaked fists.
- **The Velvet Fang** – A muli-story house of ill repute tucked into a narrow side-street. Crimson lanterns glow at its entrance; inside, silk drapes, perfumed air, and hushed laughter mask the desperate hopes—and darker deals—of its patrons.
