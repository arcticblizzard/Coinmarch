# Callus Run

**District Type**: Craft

## Summary

A bustling arc of workshops and storefronts along the north edge of Kolnmark’s lower-city thoroughfare, Callus Run stretches from the foot of the Blackspans to the fringe of Greenwold. Its shop windows gleam with hand-made wares, and the steady flow of craftsmen, apprentices and shoppers keeps the street alive from dawn until dusk.

## History & Role

Once a narrow lane of humble stables and tenements, Callus Run transformed when the city expanded westward. Artisans and small guilds claimed the frontage for metal-work, woodworking and textile dye-houses. Over time the district became Kolnmark’s premier handicraft quarter—linking the Blackspan bridges to the heart of commerce.

## Economy & Activity

Callus Run hums with the rhythm of artisan workshops and bustling storefronts. Along the north-side thoroughfare, cobblers, metalworkers, and potters open their shutters at first light, crafting everyday goods for passing traders and river crews. Midday brings a street market of mobile vendors selling quick lunches, sundry tools, and minor repairs to foot-traffic from the Blackspans and central park. By late afternoon, family-run apothecaries and tailors draw middle-class patrons, while hole-in-the-wall taverns offer a pint to lower-income workers winding down from the docks. After dusk, oil lanterns guide the last bargain hunters, and small night-shops hawk imported trinkets and local curios until the streetlights fade.

## Inhabitants

Above the ground-floor shops, narrow brick townhouses and workmen’s flats shelter journeymen, retired artisans and their families. A mix of lower-income apprentices and comfortable middle-class shopkeepers gives Callus Run its lively, layered character.

## Notable Locations

- **Artisans’ Arcade** – A covered colonnade of forty small workshops, famous for its annual “Night of Sparks” forging festival.  
- **Craftside Market** – A stretch of pop-up stalls and carts that line the main road each morning, vanishing by dusk.  
- **Blackspan Overlook** – A little plaza set atop a flight of stone steps, offering a framed view of both bridges and the river below.  
- **Journeymen’s Guild Hall** – A stout, half-timbered building at the district’s western end, its notice board covered with job postings and apprenticeships.
- **The Painted Mask Playhouse** – A modest timber-framed theatre tucked between storefronts, where groundlings squeeze into bench seating for raucous comedies and traveling troupes debut new folk dramas beneath flickering lanterns.
