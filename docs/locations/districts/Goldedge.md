# Goldedge

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

Clinging to the inner face of the northern city wall just inside the Twin Gates, Goldedge is Coinmarch’s premier middle-class neighborhood. Broad, tree-lined avenues are flanked by elegant brick townhouses and private mews; only a handful of discreet, ground-floor shops hint at the district’s mercantile roots.

## History & Role

Once a swath of orchards beyond the old gate, Goldedge was walled in during the city’s southern expansion five generations ago. Rather than host large workshops, its streets became home to the rising ranks of guild clerks, retired officers, and prosperous craftsmen who preferred quiet domesticity over the bustle of the Twinreach market. Today, Goldedge preserves its reputation as a safe, genteel quarter where families and civil servants reside in comfort.

## Economy & Activity

Goldedge’s daily rhythms center on domestic services and small-scale trades:  
- **Town-house Workshops**: Tailors, apothecaries, and bookbinders operate bespoke ateliers on the avenue level, with their living rooms just upstairs.  
- **Provision Shops**: A half-dozen corner grocers, bakeries, and butcheries serve the district’s households, while the occasional coffeehouse caters to clerks and scholars.  
- **Pocket Markets**: Weekly street stalls spring up at Pleasaunce Gardens for fresh produce, linens, and artisanal wares—favoring local makers over itinerant traders.  
- **Gate-side Services**: A few carriage houses and stables near the Twin Gates support residents who keep their own horses and coaches.

## Inhabitants

Goldedge is home to mid-rank guild administrators, retired militia officers, minor magistrates, and their families. Servants, governesses, and apprentices outnumber adult residents two to one, giving the streets a subdued but purposeful bustle. The district’s air carries the scent of rose hedges, clipped boxwood, and the faint clap of parchment in administrative offices.

## Notable Locations

- **Goldedge Terrace** – A graceful row of three-story brick townhouses set beneath iron-filigree balconies. Many feature small shopfronts—tailors’ windows or apothecary displays—beneath the families’ private quarters.  
- **Twin Gate Lodges** – Converted guardhouses flanking the city wall’s inner gate. Their vaulted ground floors now feed and house well-to-do lodgers.  
- **Silvered Ivy Gardens** – A sunken public square planted with espaliered fruit trees and clipped hedges. Every Saturday, local makers set up stalls beneath the linden boughs.  
- **Many-Hued Chapel** – A modest white-stone church built into the wall’s curtain, its stained-glass windows gleaming in morning light. The resident priest doubles as a notary for district affairs.  
- **The Quill & Ledger Office** – A discreet two-story stone building. Its ground-floor reading room and public counters serve Goldedge’s residents for notarial filings, household registrations, and guild paperwork, while a narrow oak-paneled stair leads upstairs to clerks’ offices where ledgers are kept by candlelight.
