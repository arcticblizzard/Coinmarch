# Newbrick Ward

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

A garden-lined neighborhood on the western bank of the Koln River, Newbrick Ward grew up when Kolnmark’s city walls pushed westward.  It links the Westgate to the Blackspans via the busy Timber Road—where log-drivers, merchants and craftsmen stream upriver.  Though a few workshops and a large riverside shrine dot its lanes, Newbrick remains chiefly a place to live: tidy brick terraces, modest townhouses and winding lanes leading home.

## History & Role

Originally orchards and pastures just outside the old wall, Newbrick Ward was parcelled out when Westgate was fortified.  Settlers laid straight streets of red brick, and industry crept in at the edges: a handful of tanneries, cooperages and the great Riverstone Shrine.  Today it serves as Kolnmark’s principal western suburb—home to river workers, craftsmen’s families and those who value fresh air over crowded markets.

## Economy & Activity

- **Timber Road Commerce** – Merchants and log-drivers funnel through on their way upriver, offloading timber and farm goods.  
- **Local Workshops** – Small cooperies, potteries and stonemasons’ yards cluster near the main road.  
- **Settlers’ Market** – A daily open-air square where farmers, artisans and traders sell produce, tools and household wares.  
- **Riverstone Shrine** – A large white-marble temple to the Heartstone, where river folk pray for safe passage.

## Inhabitants

Brick-faced rowhouses shelter joiners, coopers, potters and the families who keep Newbrick tidy.  Log-drivers board cheaply in local inns, while scribes, clerks and minor guild-offspring fill the quieter lanes.  At dusk, the glimmer of lanterns and the murmur of neighborhood gossip drift on the evening breeze.

## Notable Locations

- **Westgate Terrace** – The long brick thoroughfare leading from the city’s western gate into Newbrick, lined with elm trees and early morning bakeries.  
- **Settlers’ Market** – Held daily in Market Plaza, farmers and artisans haggle over fresh fruit, crafted wares and other goods shipped in via the Timber Road or the River Koln.  
- **Riverstone Shrine** – A gleaming marble temple by the riverside, where bargemen and millers leave votive stones for good fortune.  
- **Brickwall Flats** – A compact tenement block near the Westgate, offering modest rooms to craft apprentices and seasonal laborers.
- **Teamsters Unionhall** - A stout, circular brick lodge by the riverbank where log-drivers, cart-masters and haulers gather for wage negotiations, equipment exchanges and nightly camaraderie. Its broad colonnade echoes with the clank of harnesses and the thud of empty barrels.
- **Riverstone Park** - A landscaped greenbelt stretching between the shrine and the river wall, dotted with benches hewn from Koln’s own white marble.  Flowerbeds of blue irises sway in the breeze, and a trickling fountain of river-worn stone offers a quiet retreat for families and passers-by.
