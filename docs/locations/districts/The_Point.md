# The Point

**District Type**: Civic

## Summary

A broad stone promontory dividing Eastchain from Breakbay Docks, The Point is Kolnmark’s maritime nerve center—where harbor masters, customs agents and dock officials oversee the endless flow of ships. Its southern marshaling grounds roar with inspections, cargo staging and heavy machinery, while a towering lighthouse crowns the tip, guiding vessels through swirling currents.

## History & Role

Once a simple rocky outcrop marking the river’s turn, The Point became vital as Kolnmark expanded its dockyards. Custom houses and administration buildings sprouted to manage the city’s booming trade, and the marshaling grounds were carved from swamp to handle ever-larger cargo volumes. Today, it remains the beating civic heart of all import-export activity.

## Economy & Activity

By dawn, the southern marshaling grounds fill with hemp, tobacco, and exotic coffers awaiting customs inspection beneath the lighthouse’s beam. Clerks and surveyors spill from the functionary offices to weigh, stamp, and loaf paperwork for inbound and outbound cargo. Tugboats and flatboats weave among barges, delivering goods to horse-drawn carts and ox-drays awaiting their turn. Midday sees a flurry of permit negotiations in riverside cafés and cafés-cum-taverns, while blacksmiths and coopers maintain the tools of trade. As night falls, foghorns signal dock snarls cleared and paperwork closed, ready for another turn at the quay.

## Inhabitants

Civic officials, clerks, surveyors and their families populate neat rowhouses behind the office blocks. Stevedores, inspectors and pilots drift in and out, while travelers find brief rest at the single inn tucked amid the warehouses.

## Notable Locations

- **Marshaling Grounds** – Wide open stone expanse ringed by loading cranes, rails and inspection booths—where every crate and barrel is weighed, stamped and warranteed.  
- **Customs Hall** – A fortified stone pavilion of high arched windows, where imported treasures and staples alike pass under the scrutiny of the city’s revenue collectors.  
- **Dockmaster’s Office** – The operational hub of harbor traffic, its weathered plaques and signal yard alive with semaphore flags, whistles and ringing bells.  
- **Pinnacle Lighthouse** – Perched on the very tip of The Point, its ever-burning beacon and spiraling stair are both a landmark for sailors and a symbol of Kolnmark’s mastery over the river.
- **The Golden Keel** – A polished stone and mahogany tavern catering to city functionaries, ship captains, and trade barons, where crystal goblets clink and discreet ledgers exchange hands over single-malt spirits and imported vintages.
- **Banded Warehouse** – A fortress-like stone depot ringed by iron bars and watchtowers, where seized cargos and high-value imports are locked behind heavy doors and guarded around the clock by customs officers.
