# Breakbay Docks

**District Type**: Industrial

## Summary

An expansive waterfront district hugging the deep, sheltered waters of Breakbay. As Kolnmark’s principal deep-water port, it bustles with the largest ocean-going vessels, surrounded by cranes, warehouses, and the shipping offices that keep regional trade moving.

## History & Role

Originally a shallow trading quay for coastal craft, Breakbay was dredged and reinforced when larger ships first arrived from distant coasts. Over generations it has grown into the city’s main gateway for overseas commerce—where foreign spices, exotic timbers, and heavy machinery off-load at dawn and coal, ore, and finished goods depart by dusk.

## Economy & Activity

Breakbay’s docks are a hive of nonstop activity: gantries swing heavy cargo, dockhands swarm like ants loading hulls with barrels and bales. Inland, rope-walks and shipwrights toil to service every vessel; shipping clerks negotiate freight contracts in the smell of salt and oil. By twilight, tally-clerk lamps glow in office windows while watchmen patrol the quays, ensuring no crate is lost to tide or thief.  

## Inhabitants

Few call Breakbay “home”—its residents are transient seamen, customs surveyors, and labor gangs living in cramped quarters above the warehouses. A handful of longshore families run boarding houses and taverns for sailors between voyages, while the district’s stewards and foremen occupy the modest offices that line the main thoroughfare.

## Notable Locations

- **Quarantine Depot** – A squat stone building on the southern spit, where arriving crews are briefly detained and their cargoes fumigated to guard against pests and plague. Whitewashed walls and iron-barred windows give it a forbidding air.  
- **Grand Maritime Exchange** – A row of dignified granite-fronted halls lining the quay, their arched porticos draped in signal flags and rigging. Inside, tall windows flood broker’s chambers where timber-smoke drifts through ledgers and charts, and captains, merchants, and freight-brokers haggle over cargo space with the clink of silver and the creak of ship timbers ever in the background.  
- **The Iron Sheds** – Endless rows of corrugated-steel warehouses rising from the water’s edge, each door stamped with a number. Within lie coils of anchor chain, crates of machinery, and pallets of exotic goods awaiting transit.
- **Spit Tarworks** – A cluster of low, smoky sheds on the eastern shore where pitch and tar are boiled in huge cauldrons to seal and preserve wooden hulls. Acrid vapors drift over the quay, and black-stained barrels wait in neat rows.
- **Saltwood Figurehead Atelier** – A petite workshop where master carvers coax elegant figureheads and ornamental trim from gnarled driftwood. Inside, the scent of tallow, fresh sawdust, and brine mingle as captains and shipowners commission bespoke prows and rail-carvings to lend their vessels character on every voyage.
