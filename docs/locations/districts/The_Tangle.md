# The Tangle

**District Type**: Residential

## Summary

A claustrophobic warren of narrow, winding lanes wedged between the River Docks and Breakbay Quay, The Tangle is one of Kolnmark’s poorest quarters. Crumbling tenements lean over cobblestones worn smooth by decades of cart traffic, while a raucous 24-hour market rages at its crooked heart and a weekly puppet spectacle draws crowds despite the squalor.

## History & Role

Born of hasty expansion when the docks flooded the old shoreline, The Tangle grew without planning or oversight. Immigrant laborers and displaced families erected lean-tos and shoddy brickwork along every vacant alley. Guilds and watch patrols avoid its maze-like streets, leaving opportunity for both honest work and illicit trade.

## Economy & Activity

The Tangle never sleeps: cord-and-canvas stalls spring up at dawn, hawking knockoff silks, chipped ceramics, and dubious tonics to the city’s poorest. Daylight reveals tiny workshops carving kegs from rotting timbers and mending garments for dockhands, while street-corner cooks fry greasy fare for passing laborers. In the winding lanes, hucksters peddle illicit scrolls and unlicensed remedies under flickering lanterns, trading on the district’s loose oversight. Each week, puppeteers transform the central square into a carnival of strings and shadows, drawing crowds who pawn what little they have for a night of wonder. After dark, black-market brokers and fence-runners take over, ensuring The Tangle’s economy thrives on the city’s overlooked fringes.

## Inhabitants

Ragged families, itinerant dockhands and small-time peddlers cram into loft-rooms and boarded flats above the stalls. Even the most hardened street urchins pause for the puppet show, a rare delight in an unforgiving place.

## Notable Locations

- **Bright Tent Square** – The twisted center where stalls crowd every inch of open space, lit by swinging lanterns and the roar of haggling voices.  
- **Marionette Court** – A makeshift wooden stage at the north end of the square, where the weekly puppet show dazzles audiences with masterful craftsmanship.  
- **Shady Lane** – A back-alley thoroughfare of shuttered warehouses and hidden courtyards, favored by unlicensed merchants and smuggler contacts.  
- **Brickfall Tenements** – A row of crumbling brick buildings at the district’s southern edge, their sagging balconies home to dozens of families.
- **The Ragged Tankard & Scarlet Parlour** – A low-ceilinged tavern of warped floorboards and foul ale served in chipped mugs; a tattered velvet drape behind the bar leads to the Scarlet Parlour, a cramped, candlelit brothel where the district’s poorest trade coin for comfort.
